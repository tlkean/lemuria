# about lemuria
"lemuria" is a continent somewhere, someplace. like in our world, it is divided into provinces (or states, whatever), and further into cities, towns, etc. here, you can have a look around the joint. visit the states, see and read about the major attractions, *learn your way around*. you might have a good time.

really, it's for demonstrating the basics of web pages. some of the basic functions, principals, and reinforcing foundational knowledge. and maybe a bit of a showcase for some of the art-related things i do when i feel motivated.

i started this for my benefit a while ago and figured it could use some updating while i'm revisiting old curriculum. so, in the process of doing that, i'll start sharing it little-by-little as i overhaul the original.

# tl;dr about lemuria
"lemuria" is an (independent) expansion of a metaphor in the TOP curriculum.

this is an exercise in file structure (not standards), organization, file/link paths, and general 
navigation of the web.

i wrote this project and supplied all resources used within it, unless otherwise attributed. that said, feel free to take anything and use it as you please, save claiming ownership.

the "lemuria" depicted is complete and utter make-believe. nothing in this project is based on fact, nor does it claim to be.

it is not related to the [pseudoarchaeological theory of the "lost continent" of which its name is derived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemuria). i just couldn't think of a good name and i thought this would be funny. i do **not** support pseudoscience.
